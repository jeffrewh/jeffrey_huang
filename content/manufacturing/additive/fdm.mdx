## 2. Material Extrusion (e.g., FDM/FFF)

**Material Extrusion** is the most widely recognized form of 3D printing. [cite_start]It works by feeding a solid thermoplastic filament through a heated nozzle, melting it, and extruding the material onto a build platform layer by layer [cite: 7243-7244]. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) are the common names for this process.

The print head, containing the nozzle and extrusion mechanism, moves in the X-Y plane to draw each layer. [cite_start]Once a layer is complete, the build platform moves down in the Z-direction to begin the next [cite: 7273-7277]. The extruded "road" of plastic cools and solidifies, fusing to the layer below it.

The process is a balancing act of heat and force. [cite_start]Heat must flow from the heated block into the filament fast enough to melt it, but if the feed rate is too high for the temperature, the drive wheels will exert too much force and shear the solid filament, causing the extrusion to fail [cite: 7368-7406, 7423-7425].

### Key Attributes

- **Quality**: 🟡 Fair to Good. The strength of FDM parts is **anisotropic** (weaker between layers than along them) because of the layer-by-layer fusion process. [cite_start]Visible layer lines are common, affecting surface finish [cite: 7486-7496].
- **Rate**: 🟡 Medium. Faster than SLA for bulky parts, but slower than mass production methods. [cite_start]Large-scale systems like BAAM (Big Area Additive Manufacturing) are dramatically increasing rates [cite: 7468-7472].
- **Cost**: 🟢 Low. FDM machines are the most affordable, and the thermoplastic filament is a widely available, inexpensive feedstock.
- **Flexibility**: Excellent. A wide variety of engineering-grade plastics are available (ABS, PC, Nylon, etc.). [cite_start]Dual-extrusion machines can print with a soluble support material, making it easy to create complex geometries that would otherwise be impossible [cite: 7293-7323].

[cite_start]**Common Applications**: Functional prototypes, manufacturing jigs and fixtures, architectural models, and end-use consumer products[cite: 7066, 7071].
