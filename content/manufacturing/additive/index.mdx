# Additive Manufacturing (AM)

[cite_start]**Additive Manufacturing (AM)**, also known as **3D Printing**, is a transformative approach to building objects by adding material one layer at a time directly from a digital 3D model[cite: 4583]. [cite_start]This is the opposite of traditional **subtractive manufacturing**, where material is carved away from a solid block [cite: 4588-4592].

[cite_start]The core principle of all AM processes is the same: a 3D model is digitally "sliced" into thin horizontal layers, and a machine follows those instructions to deposit and fuse material, layer by layer, until the final object is complete [cite: 4826-4845].

<GlossaryTerm term="Workpiece">
  In subtractive manufacturing, this is the initial block of material from which
  a part is machined. In AM, there is no traditional workpiece; the part is
  built up from raw material feedstock (e.g., polymer filament, liquid resin, or
  powder).

### Why is Additive Manufacturing Important?

AM technology fundamentally changes the relationship between complexity and cost. In traditional manufacturing, a more complex part is almost always more expensive to make. [cite_start]In AM, complexity is essentially free; it costs no more to print an intricate lattice than it does a solid block of the same size [cite: 4717-4725]. This opens the door for:

- [cite_start]**Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly creating physical models for fit and form tests [cite: 4641-4648].
- [cite_start]**Complex Geometries**: Manufacturing shapes that are impossible to create with any other method, such as internal cooling channels or organic-looking, weight-optimized structures[cite: 4675, 4681].
- [cite_start]**Low-Volume & Custom Production**: Making small batches of parts or even one-of-a-kind personalized items (like medical implants or custom tooling) is economically viable [cite: 4679-4680, 4655-4657].
