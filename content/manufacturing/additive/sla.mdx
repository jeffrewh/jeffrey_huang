## 1. Vat Photopolymerization (e.g., SLA)

[cite_start]**Vat Photopolymerization** creates objects by selectively curing a liquid **photopolymer** resin using a focused light source, typically an ultraviolet (UV) laser [cite: 7239-7241]. Stereolithography (SLA) is the most common process in this family.

The process happens in a vat of resin. A build platform is submerged just below the surface, and the laser "draws" the first layer's cross-section, curing the resin into a solid. The platform then moves down by one layer thickness, and a sweeper blade recoats the surface with fresh resin. The laser then draws the next layer, fusing it to the one below. [cite_start]This repeats until the part is complete [cite: 7506-7517].

<GlossaryTerm term="Photopolymer">
  A special polymer that changes its properties when exposed to light.
  [cite_start]In SLA, liquid monomers and oligomers rapidly link together and
  solidify (cross-link) when struck by UV light, a process called
  photopolymerization [cite: 7541-7565].

### Key Attributes

- **Quality**: 🟢 Excellent. [cite_start]SLA is known for producing parts with very fine details and the smoothest surface finish of any major 3D printing method [cite: 7532-7535].
- **Rate**: 🔴 Slow. The point-by-point laser scanning and recoating steps can make building large or solid parts time-consuming.
- **Cost**: 🟡 Medium. Machines have become more affordable, but the proprietary liquid resins are often more expensive than thermoplastic filaments.
- **Flexibility**: Good for intricate shapes, but material choice is limited to photopolymers, which can be brittle. [cite_start]Parts often require support structures that must be removed later and a final UV post-curing step to achieve full strength [cite: 7530-7531].

[cite_start]**Common Applications**: Dental molds and aligners, jewelry casting patterns, hearing aids, and detailed prototypes where visual appearance is critical [cite: 7518-7528].
