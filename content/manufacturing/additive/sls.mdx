## 3. Powder Bed Fusion (e.g., SLS/SLM)

[cite_start]**Powder Bed Fusion** processes use a high-energy source, like a laser or an electron beam, to selectively fuse regions of a powder bed [cite: 7246-7247]. The two main types are **Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)**, which typically uses polymers, and **Selective Laser Melting (SLM)** or **Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS)**, which are used for metals.

The process takes place inside a chamber. A roller or blade spreads an extremely thin layer of powder (e.g., titanium, aluminum, nylon) over a build platform. A powerful laser then scans the cross-section of the part, melting and fusing the powder particles together. [cite_start]The platform then lowers, a new layer of powder is applied, and the process repeats [cite: 7675-7686].

[cite_start]The physics are complex, involving rapid melting and resolidification that creates unique material **microstructures** [cite: 7897-7902]. [cite_start]Controlling the process window—the balance of laser power, scan speed, and layer thickness—is critical to creating fully dense parts without defects [cite: 7828-7862].

### Key Attributes

- **Quality**: 🟢 Good to Excellent. [cite_start]SLM can produce metal parts with mechanical properties comparable or even superior to cast parts [cite: 7936-7941]. The main drawback is surface finish, which is often rough due to the nature of the powder particles.
- **Rate**: 🔴 Slow. The process of recoating and scanning is time-consuming, though multiple parts can be nested together in the build volume to improve throughput.
- **Cost**: 🔴 High. The machines, specialized metal powders, and required post-processing (powder removal, stress-relief heat treatment, support removal) make this one of the most expensive manufacturing processes per part.
- **Flexibility**: Excellent. Parts are supported by the surrounding unfused powder, so support structures are often not needed, allowing for extremely complex geometries. [cite_start]It's a leading method for creating topology-optimized, lightweight parts [cite: 7710-7714].

[cite_start]**Common Applications**: High-value, performance-critical parts like aerospace fuel nozzles and brackets, and custom medical implants (e.g., titanium hip cups) where the rough surface finish aids bone integration [cite: 7081, 7687-7709, 8006-8019].
