# Casting Processes

[cite_start]**Casting** is a foundational manufacturing process where a molten material, usually metal, is poured into a hollow mold of a desired shape and allowed to cool and solidify [cite: 5628-5629]. The solidified part, known as the casting, is then ejected or broken out of the mold. [cite_start]It is one of the most versatile manufacturing methods, capable of producing parts with incredible complexity and a vast range of sizes, from a small ring to a massive ship propeller [cite: 5630-5636].

## The Core Casting Workflow

[cite_start]While there are many different types of casting, they all follow the same fundamental sequence [cite: 5720-5726]:

1.  **Pattern & Mold Making**: A mold is created that contains a cavity in the shape of the desired part. For parts with internal features, a separate piece called a **core** is used to form that space.
2.  **Melting & Pouring**: The chosen metal is melted in a furnace and then poured into the mold's gating system.
3.  **Solidification**: The molten metal cools and solidifies within the mold, taking on the shape of the cavity.
4.  **Removal & Finishing**: The solidified part is removed from the mold. The excess material from the gating system is cut off, and the part may undergo cleaning, inspection, or secondary machining.

<GlossaryTerm term="Riser">
  [cite_start]A **riser** is a reservoir of molten metal built into the
  mold[cite: 5734]. As the metal in the main cavity cools and shrinks, the riser
  feeds additional molten metal into the part, preventing the formation of voids
  or shrinkage cavities. [cite_start]The riser is designed to be the last part
  of the system to solidify[cite: 5734].

## Process Physics: Flow and Cooling

The success of a casting operation is governed by two key physical phenomena: fluidity and heat transfer.

### Fluidity

[cite_start]**Fluidity** is the ability of the molten metal to flow and fill the mold's intricate details before it freezes [cite: 5881-5883]. It's a critical property influenced by:

- **Temperature**: Higher temperatures above the melting point (**superheat**) increase fluidity.
- **Viscosity & Surface Tension**: Lower viscosity and surface tension allow the metal to flow more easily into thin sections.
- [cite_start]**Gating System Design**: A well-designed system ensures laminar (smooth) flow to prevent air bubbles and oxides from being trapped in the final part [cite: 5884-5886].

### Solidification Time & Chvorinov's Rule

The time it takes for a casting to solidify is a primary driver of the production rate and the final microstructure of the part. This is predicted by **Chvorinov's Rule**:

$$ t\_{solidify} = C \cdot \left(\frac{V}{A}\right)^n $$

[cite_start]Where $V$ is the volume of the casting and $A$ is its surface area [cite: 5932-5936]. The key takeaway is that parts with a higher **volume-to-surface-area ratio** (i.e., thicker, more compact sections) cool more slowly. The mold constant, $C$, and exponent, $n$, depend heavily on the mold material (e.g., insulating sand vs. conductive steel).

### Shrinkage

[cite_start]Nearly all metals shrink as they cool and solidify, and this is the most common cause of defects in castings [cite: 6069-6076]. Shrinkage occurs in three stages:

1.  **Liquid Contraction**: Cooling of the liquid metal before solidification.
2.  **Solidification Shrinkage**: The phase change from liquid to solid causes a significant volume decrease. This is the primary shrinkage compensated for by the riser.
3.  **Solid Thermal Contraction**: The solid part continues to shrink as it cools to room temperature. This is compensated for by making the mold cavity slightly oversized.

## Microstructure of Cast Parts

The cooling rate during solidification directly controls the grain structure of the final part, which in turn determines its mechanical properties like strength and ductility.

- [cite_start]**Fast Cooling** (e.g., against a cold metal mold wall) creates a **chill zone** of very fine, equiaxed (uniform) grains [cite: 6016-6017].
- [cite_start]**Directional Cooling** causes **columnar grains** to grow perpendicular to the mold wall, toward the hotter center of the casting[cite: 6014].
- [cite_start]**Slow Cooling** (in the center of a thick section) creates a large, equiaxed grain structure [cite: 6012-6013].

According to the **Hall-Petch relationship**, smaller grains result in a stronger material. [cite_start]Therefore, the faster a casting solidifies, the stronger it tends to be [cite: 6024-6031].
