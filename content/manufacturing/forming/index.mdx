# Forming & Net-Shape Processes

[cite_start]**Forming and Net-Shape Processes** are a broad class of manufacturing operations that create a part's final geometry through methods like plastic deformation or solidification, rather than by removing material [cite: 1924-1927].

The goal of these processes is to produce a part that is either very close to its final dimensions (**near-net-shape**) or is exactly at its final dimensions (**net-shape**). This is a key advantage as it minimizes or even eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming secondary machining.

A simple analogy is making a waffle. You pour liquid batter (the material) into a shaped mold (the tool), and it solidifies into its final, net-shape form. You aren't carving the waffle out of a giant block of bread.

## Major Categories of Forming Processes

This family includes some of the most widely used manufacturing techniques for both metals and polymers.

### 1. Casting

[cite_start]**Casting** is the process of pouring a molten material, typically metal, into a hollow mold and allowing it to cool and solidify [cite: 3783-3784]. The solidified part takes on the shape of the mold's cavity. [cite_start]It is an extremely versatile method used to create complex geometries, including internal features, that would be difficult or impossible to machine[cite: 3795].

### 2. Polymer Molding

This involves shaping heated polymers using a mold. The two most common methods are:

- [cite_start]**Injection Molding**: Molten plastic pellets are forced under high pressure into a closed mold cavity[cite: 1066]. It is the dominant process for mass-producing complex plastic parts.
- [cite_start]**Thermoforming**: A heated sheet of plastic is stretched over or into a mold and held there until it cools [cite: 1497-1498]. It's ideal for producing thin-walled parts like packaging and enclosures.

### 3. Sheet Metal Forming

This category covers processes that shape metal sheets into parts through **plastic deformation**, typically without changing the material's thickness. Key processes include:

- **Bending**: Deforming the metal along a straight axis.
- [cite_start]**Stamping / Drawing**: Forcing a sheet of metal into a die to create a 3D shape, like a car body panel [cite: 1984-1989].

## Key Physical Concepts

<GlossaryTerm term="Plastic Deformation">
  The permanent change in a material's shape that occurs when it is subjected to
  a stress exceeding its **yield strength**. This is the fundamental mechanism
  behind all sheet metal forming processes. [cite_start]After the load is
  removed, the material does not return to its original shape, a phenomenon
  known as **springback** [cite: 1999-2001].
</GlossaryTerm>

<GlossaryTerm term="Solidification & Shrinkage">
  This is the dominant physical process in casting and molding. [cite_start]As a
  material cools from a liquid to a solid, its density increases, causing it to
  shrink in volume [cite: 4156-4160]. This shrinkage must be carefully accounted
  for in the mold design to ensure the final part has the correct dimensions.
  [cite_start]Failure to do so results in defects like **shrinkage cavities**
  [cite: 4230-4235].
