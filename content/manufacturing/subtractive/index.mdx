# Subtractive Manufacturing

[cite_start]**Subtractive Manufacturing** is a family of processes that create a final part by selectively removing material from a larger solid block, known as a **workpiece** [cite: 192-194]. [cite_start]This "top-down" approach is the inverse of Additive Manufacturing, which builds parts "bottom-up" from nothing [cite: 4462-4466].

Think of it like a sculptor carving a statue from a block of marble. The final form is revealed by chipping away the unwanted material. Similarly, in manufacturing, a block of metal or plastic is cut, drilled, or ground down to its final, precise geometry.

## Core Processes in Subtractive Manufacturing

While there are many methods, the vast majority of subtractive manufacturing falls under one major category:

### Machining

[cite_start]**Machining** is a general term for processes that use a cutting tool to mechanically shear away material in the form of chips [cite: 192-194]. It is the most common and versatile subtractive method, capable of producing parts with extremely high precision and excellent surface finishes. We will cover the specific mechanics of this in a dedicated page. The two primary forms are:

- [cite_start]**Turning**: The workpiece rotates while a stationary cutting tool removes material (e.g., making a cylindrical shaft on a lathe)[cite: 197].
- [cite_start]**Milling**: A rotating cutting tool moves relative to a stationary workpiece to create flat or complex surfaces (e.g., carving out a pocket or drilling a hole)[cite: 197].

### Non-Traditional Machining

These are processes that remove material using energy sources other than traditional cutting tools. [cite_start]They are often used for very hard materials or for creating features that are difficult or impossible to achieve with standard machining[cite: 196]. Examples include:

- **Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM)**
- **Laser Machining / Cutting**
- **Water Jet Cutting**

## Key Concepts in Subtractive Manufacturing

<GlossaryTerm term="Tolerances">
  **Tolerances** refer to the permissible limit or limits of variation in a
  physical dimension of a part. [cite_start]Subtractive processes like machining
  are known for their ability to achieve very tight tolerances, often on the
  order of thousandths of an inch (micrometers)[cite: 207].

<GlossaryTerm term="Fixturing">
  **Fixturing** is the process of securely holding the workpiece in place while
  it is being machined. A good fixture must hold the part rigidly to resist high
  cutting forces, but without deforming the part itself. [cite_start]The design
  of the part often dictates how it can be held, which is a key principle in
  **Design for Manufacturing (DFM)**[cite: 903, 917].
